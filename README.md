# Python-Excel-Data-Entry-App

This is a Python application that allows users to enter data manually and save it in an Excel file using the openpyxl library. The application prompts the user for input and writes the input to a new row in the Excel file.


# Getting Started

To use this application, you'll need to have Python and the openpyxl library installed. You can install openpyxl using pip:
- pip install openpyxl

Once you have the required dependencies installed, you can run the Script.py file to start the application:
- python Script.py

The application will prompt you to enter a name, age, and city for each set of data. To quit the loop, enter 'q'. The data entered by the user will be saved in an Excel file named Data.xlsx in the same directory as the Script.py file.
